# Effects of Mixed-Wood Biochar on Fertilizer Use Efficiency and Growth Performance of Okra

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data-analysis workflow, statistical outputs, visualizations, and supporting materials for a pot experiment investigating the effects of mixed-wood biochar application on the growth, yield-related characteristics, and nutrient status of okra (*Abelmoschus esculentus* L.).

The project was developed to evaluate whether increasing biochar application rates influence plant growth, biomass production, yield components, and plant/grain nutrient concentrations under a common fertilizer regime.

> **Research status:** This work is currently unpublished. The repository is intended to document the experimental analysis workflow and research outputs.

## Research Objective

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of different mixed-wood biochar application rates on:

- Plant growth and biomass
- Pod production and yield-related traits
- Root and shoot development
- Nutrient concentrations
- Estimated nutrient uptake
- Overall fertilizer-use efficiency and crop performance

## Research Team & Collaboration

This project was conducted as a **collaborative experimental research study** by **Qurrat-ul-Ain** and **Moazzam Riaz**.

The research collaboration involved experimental work, data collection and organization, data analysis, interpretation of results, and documentation of the research workflow. Both contributors participated in the development and documentation of the experimental work. Specific analytical and experimental responsibilities are documented according to their respective contributions to the project.

## Experimental Design

The experiment followed a **Completely Randomized Design (CRD)**.

- **Treatments:** 5
- **Replications:** 3 per treatment
- **Total experimental units:** 15
- **Design:** Completely Randomized Design (CRD)

Each treatment was represented by three independent experimental units.

### Treatment Plan

| Treatment | Biochar application |
|-----------|---------------------|
| T0 | Control – no biochar |
| T1 | 5 t/ha biochar |
| T2 | 10 t/ha biochar |
| T3 | 15 t/ha biochar |
| T4 | 20 t/ha biochar |

The experimental treatments were evaluated under the same fertilizer regime.

## Variables Analyzed

### Growth and Biomass

- Plant height (cm)
- Shoot fresh weight (g)
- Shoot dry weight (g)
- Root fresh weight (g)
- Root dry weight (g)

### Yield and Yield Components

- Pod fresh weight (g)
- Pod dry weight (g)
- Pods per plant
- Grains per pod
- Pod length (cm)

### Nutrient Variables

- Plant N (%)
- Plant P (%)
- Plant K (%)
- Grain N (%)
- Grain P (%)
- Grain K (%)

### Nutrient Uptake

Estimated N, P, and K uptake were also summarized and statistically evaluated using biomass and nutrient concentration data.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in **R**.

For each response variable, treatment effects were evaluated using one-way ANOVA appropriate for the completely randomized design:
